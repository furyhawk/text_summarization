The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting Â£1.3m in.\\n\"So it\\'s a total pot of just over Â£3m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we\\'d probably get five or six players.\\n\"And I\\'ve always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I\\'d rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or soâ€¦ you\\'re looking at your Liam Williams\\' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\\n\"Now, if that can be done and there\\'s some spare monies available at the end, yes, let\\'s look to bring players back.\\n\"But it\\'s a cruel world, isn\\'t it?\\n\"It\\'s fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there\\'s enough money.\"\\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L\\'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.',\n",

They relate to a range of consumer complaints about banks, insurers and other financial businesses.\\nThis was a 3% rise on the previous six months.\\nThe ombudsman only deals with disputes that cannot be resolved between a consumer and a financial institution, so only reflects a fraction of the total number of unhappy customers.\\nIt found in consumers' favour in just under half (48%) of cases completed in the first half of the year.\\nThe figures show that payday lending was one area in which complaints had risen in the first half of the year, up from 1,213 in the previous six months. Some 53% of payday complaints were upheld.\\nThe ombudsman said the rise was partly due to greater consumer awareness of their rights.\\nThe Consumer Finance Association, which represents some of the major payday providers, claimed most customers felt they were treated better by payday operators than by other types of lenders.\\nRussell Hamblin-Boone, the association's chief executive, said: \"We are obviously disappointed with the number of complaints, but this must be viewed in perspective. Of around a million loans funded there were about 2,000 upheld complaints.\\n\"The true picture is represented by a recent customer satisfaction survey by Smart Money People, which showed that 95% of short-term credit customers felt they were treated fairly against an average of 88% of all credit customers.\"\\nPPI complaints - made by those who felt they had been mis-sold the loan insurance - fell slightly compared to the second half of 2015, continuing a trend.\\nChief financial ombudsman Caroline Wayman said that PPI still weighed heavily on the organisation's workload.\\n\"Although it is a few years now since PPI complaints peaked, we have been receiving over 3,000 a week for six years running - despite wider expectations that numbers will fall,\" she said. \"We are continuing to deal with the issues and uncertainties around PPI which remain a significant challenge for everyone involved.\"\\nPPI was designed to cover loan repayments if the policyholder fell ill or lost their job.\\nAbout 45 million policies were sold over the course of 20 years from 1990.\\nHowever, it became clear that it was mis-sold on an industrial scale to people who didn't want or need it - or would not be eligible to claim.\\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to set a June 2019 deadline for people to make claims over mis-sold PPI. Banks have so far paid out Ã‚Â£24bn in compensation.\\nThe UK's five biggest banks have set aside Ã‚Â£32.6bn to deal with the total compensation bill.\\nThis is the major reason why the largest number of complaints made to the ombudsman in the first six months of the year was about Lloyds Banking Group.\\nThe Bank of Scotland and Barclays were next on the list.</td>\n",

This season alone, Neil Warnock's Rotherham United revival stands out as an impressive feat - an 11-match unbeaten run guiding the club from the Championship relegation zone to nine points clear of danger. There are comparable tales almost every season, too.\\nAnd incomparable tales - a police dog called Bryn helped Torquay United to stay up 1987; Aberdeen avoided relegation from the Scottish Premier League in 2000 because Falkirk's ground was not considered good enough to see them promoted; and Jimmy Glass - the goalkeeper's last-minute winner keeping Carlisle in League Two in 1999.\\nBut pouring over 127 years of records was quite a daunting task, so we kept to the recent past and looked at the top flight, where the prize for staying up is the most lucrative.\\nWe considered the run-in for each club by taking the last 10 games of the season into account, looking at their results - and worked out a score based on who they played too.\\nOf course, it's not an exact science, but here are our top contenders:\\nRun in: P10 W3 D1 L6 Pts 10\\nPosition with 10 games left: 18th, two points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - they stayed up by three points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 11th, including eventual champions Manchester United\\nThe Bantams' end to the season doesn't look anything special at first - their last 10 games saw five successive defeats to Coventry, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Southampton and Everton, leaving them six points from safety with five to go.\\nTheir 10 points came in their last five games - including a final day win against Liverpool at Valley Parade. Cue celebrations.\\nRun in: P10 W3 D2 L3 Pts 11\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th, five points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - they stayed up by one point\\nAverage position of teams faced: 8th, including all the top four\\nThe first team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas. Bryan Robson's team were supposedly doomed but managed to stay up despite a final-day win over Portsmouth being their only victory in their last seven games.\\nThey managed a win and a draw against two of the eventual top four (Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton) they played in the run-in as well. Portsmouth fans at the Hawthorns also celebrated at the end of the game as the Baggies' win meant their south-coast rivals Southampton dropped out of the division.\\nRun in: P10 W5 D2 L3 Pts 17\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th - six points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - stayed up by +3 goal difference over Reading\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th - they lost to Liverpool, the only top-four side faced in the run-in.\\nFulham's tale is similar to Bradford's survival story - in that they were still six points from safety with five games to go. Roy Hodgson, who had replaced Lawrie Sanchez in December, inspired his side to three wins in their final three games - including a dramatic 3-2 victory at Manchester City. A final day win at Portsmouth secured their status, but only on goal difference.\\nRun in: P10 W5 D3 L2 Pts 18\\nPosition with 10 games left: 22nd (bottom, and three points from safety)\\nFinal position: 19th - stayed up on goal difference (+2 better than Crystal Palace, who lost 3-0 at Arsenal)\\nAverage position of teams faced: 10th\\nPaul Scholes' favourite club stayed up by the skin of their teeth in the Premier League's inaugural season, largely thanks to three wins in their last three matches. That included a victory at title-chasing Aston Villa, as well as beating sixth-placed Liverpool in the penultimate game of the campaign.\\nOnly champions Manchester United and a fourth-placed Blackburn Rovers side with Alan Shearer up front scored more goals than Oldham that season.\\nRun in: P10 W4 D3 L3 Pts 18\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th (three points from safety)\\nFinal position: 16th - stayed up by two points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th\\nFacing six sides in the bottom half of the table certainly helped the Graeme Souness-led Saints to survive in those final 10 games. The signing of Ali Dia did not.\\nAfter losing to top-six sides Arsenal and Chelsea, Southampton went on a seven-match unbeaten run that ensured they only needed a draw in their last game to stay up. They lost, but stayed up all the same as other results went their way.\\nRun in: P10 W6 D2 L2 Pts 20\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th (eight points from safety)\\nFinal position: 17th - stayed up by four points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 11th\\nWhen Alain Perrin was sacked mid-season, Portsmouth enticed ex-boss Harry Redknapp back to the club from neighbours Southampton. It looked like a poisoned chalice, with the struggling side firmly in the relegation zone.\\nBut end-of-season Champions League form saw Pompey turn an eight-point gap into a healthy four-point cushion over 10 games, with survival confirmed before a final-day loss at home to third-placed Liverpool.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D0 L3 Pts 21\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th (10 points from safety)\\nFinal position: 15th - stayed up with a three-point gap\\nAverage position of teams faced: 8th\\nIf you thought Portsmouth's late run was impressive, the Hammers overcame an even bigger gap with seven wins from their last 10 games. They even played five of the top six in that run.\\nBut the should they have stayed up? Carlos Tevez scored the only goal in the final-day win at title-winners Manchester United which confirmed survival, but the Argentina international nearly saw the club sent packing to the Championship in one of the Premier League's most controversial episodes.\\nThe signings of both Tevez and compatriot Javier Mascherano had breached third-party ownership rules, leading to the threat of a points deduction as punishment. As it was, the Premier League stopped short of this measure, fining the club Â£5.5m.\\nThe other relegated clubs were less than pleased, though. Sheffield United took the matter to a tribunal which resulted in the London club paying Â£20m in compensation to the Blades.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D1 L2 Pts 22\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th - one point from safety\\nFinal position: 15th- stayed up by seven points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 10th\\nWigan's remarkable run-in included wins at Arsenal and at home to title-chasing Manchester United, a 4-0 hammering of a Newcastle United side that had hoped to secure Champions League football and only a last-minute winner stopped them getting a point at Chelsea.\\nHad they not faced the bottom two clubs in their last two games - by which point they were already safe - the average position of the teams faced in their run in would have been seventh. It was all in stark contrast to a side that had conceded three or more goals 10 times up to that point.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D1 L2 Pts 22\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th - seven points off safety\\nFinal position: 14th - six points from the relegation zone\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th\\nAfter spending four and a half months propping up the Premier League table, struggling Leicester were dead and buried as far as most pundits were concerned. True, they had played well for much of the season but lacked the real quality to turn performances into points, it was said.\\nSeven wins from their last nine turned that theory on its head, as the supposedly doomed club landed practically in mid-table.\\nThey were, though, helped by the fact most games were against other clubs in the bottom half of the table.\\nMaybe that's why they remained most people's tip for relegation the following year...\\nLet us know your thoughts - and which stories from the wider football world deserve to be in there?

       "      <td>Reacting to light is the job of the rods and cones in the retina, but these can be destroyed by disease.\\nA study, in the journal Neuron, showed a chemical could give \"support-duty cells\" in the eye the power to respond readily to light.\\nExperts said it was a fascinating concept which might lead to treatments, but stressed more research was needed.\\nThe eye is built of layers including the rods and cones.\\nOther layers keep the rods and cones alive, as well as passing on electrical signals produced by the light-sensing cells and passing these on to the brain.\\nResearchers at the University of California, Berkeley, were focused on a type of nerve cell in the eye - retinal ganglion cells.\\nThey designed a chemical - called Denaq - which changes shape in response to light. The shape-shift alters the chemistry of the cell and results in electrical signals being sent to the brain.\\nTests showed that injecting Denaq into the eyes of blind mice restored a degree of vision. There were changes in behaviour, although it is not clear how well the mice could see.\\nThe effects wore off quickly, but mice could still detect light a week later.\\nOne of the researchers, Dr Richard Kramer, said: \"Further testing on larger mammals is needed to assess the short and long-term safety of Denaq.\\n\"It will take several more years, but if safety can be established, these compounds might ultimately be useful for restoring light sensitivity to blind humans.\\n\"How close they can come to re-establishing normal vision remains to be seen.\"\\nIt is hoped the drug could eventually help with diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.\\nThe researchers envisage using electronic goggles to beam appropriate intensity light on to the retina to improve the efficiency.\\nProf Astrid Limb, from the Institute for Ophthalmology at University College London, told the BBC: \"It's a very interesting concept that you can stimulate the remaining cells.\\n\"However, there is still a lot of work to do before this research can be applied to humans.\"\\nShe added the drug's duration would need to be addressed, asking: \"Can you imagine giving an injection every few days?\"\\nThe findings add to a range of developments in restoring sight to the blind which also include transplanting stem cells into the back of the eye to restore vision and manipulating DNA to correct genetic defects.</td>\n",
