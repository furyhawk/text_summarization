The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting Â£1.3m in.\\n\"So it\\'s a total pot of just over Â£3m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we\\'d probably get five or six players.\\n\"And I\\'ve always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I\\'d rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or soâ€¦ you\\'re looking at your Liam Williams\\' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\\n\"Now, if that can be done and there\\'s some spare monies available at the end, yes, let\\'s look to bring players back.\\n\"But it\\'s a cruel world, isn\\'t it?\\n\"It\\'s fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there\\'s enough money.\"\\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L\\'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.',\n",

Police are using lists of wanted criminals, but say the main goal is to disrupt the terror networks.\\nIt will be several days before it becomes clear whether they have managed to arrest members of the groups carrying out the sectarian killings.\\nThe government says home-grown militants with links to opposition parties such as the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami are seeking to destabilise the country.\\nMore recently, a government minister even suggested that Israeli intelligence was behind the killings, alleging that a senior BNP leader had recently met a Mossad operative in India.\\nThe opposition leader, Aslam Chowdhury, is now in jail facing treason charges. The Israeli in question turned out to be a former adviser to an Israeli minister who heads a public advocacy programme.\\nMany people worry that the government is trying to use these attacks to batter an already weakened political opposition.\\nIn the past week, a Hindu priest, a Christian grocer, and the wife of an anti-terror police officer were all killed in attacks by suspected Islamist militants.\\nSecular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists, and other members of religious minorities are also among those to have been killed in recent months.\\nPolice say they have made a list of suspects wanted for more than 40 targeted killings over the past three years, based on intelligence reports.\\nHowever, not all of the 900 people arrested are suspected militants, Shahidur Rahman, Deputy Inspector General of Police, told BBC Bengali.\\nWho is behind the Bangladesh killings?\\nIs extremism on the rise in Bangladesh?\\nLurching from secularism to sectarian terror?\\n\"Many of them are suspected for other regular crimes. Police will interrogate them and try to find who is responsible for what,\" he said.\\nCorrespondents say petty criminals may be among those detained as the authorities believe they could have information about the militants. Some of those held are likely to be freed after questioning.\\nAnalysts say the killing of a police officer's wife on Sunday may have triggered the crackdown.\\nShahidul Hoque, inspector general of police, vowed on Thursday that those responsible for killing her would be \"brought to justice very soon\".\\nSecular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists, and members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus have all been killed, many of them hacked to death.\\nA university professor whose family said he was not an atheist was murdered in April, suggesting the list of those at risk had widened further.\\nWho exactly is behind the attacks remains unclear. Bangladesh has myriad extremist groups and there have been few convictions over the attacks.\\nMany of the attacks have been claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS) or al-Qaeda linked groups.\\nHowever, the government has disputed these claims. Instead, government members have blamed opposition parties and local Islamist groups. Bangladesh's home minister has suggested an Israeli link to the killings, describing an \"international conspiracy\" against Bangladesh.\\nBoth the opposition and the Israeli government have denied any involvement - and Israel described the accusations as \"utter drivel\".\\nUntil the killings stop the government itself will face accusations of not doing enough to protect minorities in the Sunni-dominated nation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Huw Lewis warned it would take \"some years\" to learn lessons after Wales again fell behind the rest of the UK in an international study.\\nThe tests in science, maths, and reading were taken by 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries.\\nThe UK government's Education Secretary Michael Gove described Wales as a \"country going backwards\".\\nWales had lower results on average in the three subjects than England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\\nFacing questions from assembly members, First Minister Carwyn Jones assured them education in Wales was not in \"crisis\".\\nThe figures, from the Programme For International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests, were published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\\nMr Lewis said Wales was on an \"education improvement journey\" which had \"no quick fixes\" within it.\\nHe told BBC Wales: \"It's going to take some years to learn the lessons of Pisa and turn the system around to meet the challenges it meets to us.\\n\"Everyone from myself to leaders of local authorities, teachers, school governors - everyone needs to take a good long look in the mirror and recognise the challenge is for them as well as the people around them.\"\\nMr Lewis admitted: \"There could be questions about us taking our eye off the ball in the mid 2000s around the basics in education.\"\\nBut he insisted Welsh ministers did \"take heed\" of previous poor Pisa results in 2009, and instituted \"one of the most radical and ambitious reform programmes that Welsh education has ever seen\".\\nBut he said such reforms \"take time to have traction\".\\n\"It's barely a year since these reforms were instituted,\" he said.\\nBut he conceded significant mistakes might previously have been made in key areas.\\n\"I think there could be questions raised around taking our eye off the ball in the mid-2000s around the basics in education, literacy and numeracy - we've certainly put that right\".\\n\"We're going to go for the very best we can achieve... everyone in the system, I'm asking them to join with me in recognising that to do that we need to step change in terms of what we expect from the system and the challenge we put down to our teachers, our pupils and to the machinery of education in Wales.\\n\"We need to take things to a whole new level,\" he added.\\nWhile Mr Lewis said there was \"not all that much to celebrate\" in the rest of the UK, Mr Gove used Wales' performance in the Pisa tests to berate the Labour front bench in the House of Commons.\\nHe told MPs: \"I'm afraid it's the case that in Wales, a country for which I have an enormous amount of affection, the Welsh Labour government chose to abandon league tables, abandon external accountability, and the current Welsh administration is unfortunately not matching our commitment to spending in schools.\\n\"And the conclusion that we can draw from this is, if you want to know what our education system would be like if the country were foolishly to vote Labour at the next election, you need only to look over the Severn to see a country going backwards.\"\\nDuring tense exchanges on education in First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the Pisa results were \"more damning evidence of educational failure under Labour\".\\nHe told Mr Jones: \"You cannot show any humility to the people of Wales, who've depended on education as a route out from poverty, as a route to good jobs, and above all developing an economy fit for the twenty-first century.\"\\nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the Welsh government would be in \"special measures\" if it were a local authority.\\n\"Why should parents continue to trust your government with their children's education?\" she asked.\\nFor Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams the \"abject failure\" of Labour's education policies had been \"exposed for everyone to see\".\\n\"As a Labour assembly member for 14 years, as a cabinet member for 13 years and now as the  first minister of our nation, are you not ashamed?\" she said.\\nMr Jones insisted there had been \"an improvement\" but \"not enough\" this year, and he listed ways he argued ministers were seeking to improve educational performance:\\n\"The National Literacy and Numeracy Programme, the National Support Programme, supporting professional development, Teach First Wales, leadership development, strengthening accountability, Learning Wales, the national model for regional working and dealing with attendance and behaviour, all put in place since 2009,\" he told AMs.\\n\"As I've said, it will take a little more time for these improvements to have their full force.\"\\nThe first minister said his message to all three opposition parties was \"if you don't like it, what would you change?\"\\nThe opposition parties had \"signally failed\" to outline what they would do differently, he said.</td>\n",
