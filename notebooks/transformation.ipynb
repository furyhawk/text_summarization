       " '\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOnline role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?\\n\\nWhen video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. \"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas. Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I\\'m not going to get it, there\\'s no way I could limit the hours I\\'d spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.\\n\\nBut some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"\\'You need to get out more\\' could be the motto of any MMORPG. Shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,\" wrote Stuart Stanton-Davies, in Huddersfield. Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.\\n\\nGaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.\\n\\nUnfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. And the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.\\n\\nMassively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. Part of the \"problem\" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. Such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is EverQuest (EQ) nicknamed EverCrack. E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. \"By \\'a lot\\', I mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where I didn\\'t have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.\"\\n\\nHe says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn\\'t that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much\". \"You lie; you don\\'t go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time. He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.\\n\\nLet us be clear - such obsession is rare. But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. Only a fraction will descend into obsessives. The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. \"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than \\'some\\' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said. One unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: \"On the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as I do, I find that I am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t talk to him while he is playing. There is absolutely no point as he doesn\\'t hear me or is so distracted that I get a \\'ummm... ya\\' a few minutes after I ask him a question.\"\\n\\n\"Gaming widows\" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. But for some it is not in the least funny. Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\" And some of them are even sadder: \"Today our son was five days old. \"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game. He did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online.\" Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. But as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn\\'t. An 11 hour stretch isn\\'t that surprising - I\\'ve known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. I know of people who are spending their week\\'s holiday from work playing Warcraft. I know of people who would play Ever[Crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they \\'needed\\' to appear. I understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. By all standards many of us are addicts. So is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?\\n\\nSadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them. I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.\\n\\nI think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don\\'t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.\\n\\nI have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. RPGs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing. When you stop playing you\\'re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you\\'ve gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.\\n\\nDespite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily. If only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?\\n\\nMy advice to gaming widows is \"if you can\\'t beat \\'em, join \\'em\". That is, try playing it yourself. If he wants to play as well, well at least you\\'ll be together somewhere...\\n\\nI was an addict and it cost me my relationship. I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting? From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job. For the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.\\n\\nObsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of \"reality\". Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem. This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. An obsessive EQ player does not consider the game to be \"real\" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.\\n\\nThe problem with these so called MMORPGS is that you can never really complete them, there\\'s always another quest to do. A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...\\n\\nChampionship Manager consumed my life for years. One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.\\n\\nI used to be an EverQuest addict while I was in college. It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. I failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. I was lucky that I came to my senses when I did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague.\\n\\nWhen I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.\\n\\nWhen I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I\\'m trying not to spend so much time on there. It\\'s not easy. I feel as if I\\'ve got a real addiction going on here.\\n\\nFor me the problem is that I love to complete a goal. Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on. I become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world. Pretty scary implications if you think about it.\\n\\nI can\\'t buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!!\\n\\nI played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. I\\'m sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. Thankfully I made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my Jedi account for Ã‚Â£800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.\\n\\nSeven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online. This game dominated 2 years of my life. They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had. Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.\\n\\nGaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. But somehow I found time to get out, even met someone and got married! Has my life changed? Hell no! I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. On with the fun!\\n\\nOnline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.\\n\\nMany people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. According to this article the same is true of MMORPGs. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!\\n\\nSounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all. I play alot of Warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. I am resolute that it will not take over my life. It certainly gets in the way though. I think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.\\n\\nI think I\\'m obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I\\'m always thinking in the back if my mind that I\\'d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.\\n\\nI am obsessed with online role playing games. It\\'s not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...\\n\\nAs many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.\\n\\nThese games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.\\n\\nLiving in Korea at the moment, they have lots PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\\n\\nI play xbox live every day. I find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session. I know I play for to long but it\\'s an obsession that I can\\'t control. Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I\\'m increasingly concerned with...\\n\\nMe and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we\\'re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to \\'frag\\' some individual. It\\'s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying \\'real\\' life...\\n\\nI bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out. The longest period I played was 23 hrs straight. I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn\\'t help myself). In future, I\\'m going to regulate my time far more strictly. Great game!\\n\\nHaving played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking. But my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.\\n\\nUnless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.\\n\\nThese people are pathetic. They need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and \"online universe\" absolutely meaningless.\\n\\n24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days !

      "Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\n",
      "\n",
      "Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Ã‚Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.\n",

The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting Â£1.3m in.\\n\"So it\\'s a total pot of just over Â£3m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we\\'d probably get five or six players.\\n\"And I\\'ve always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I\\'d rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or soâ€¦ you\\'re looking at your Liam Williams\\' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\\n\"Now, if that can be done and there\\'s some spare monies available at the end, yes, let\\'s look to bring players back.\\n\"But it\\'s a cruel world, isn\\'t it?\\n\"It\\'s fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there\\'s enough money.\"\\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L\\'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.',\n",

They relate to a range of consumer complaints about banks, insurers and other financial businesses.\\nThis was a 3% rise on the previous six months.\\nThe ombudsman only deals with disputes that cannot be resolved between a consumer and a financial institution, so only reflects a fraction of the total number of unhappy customers.\\nIt found in consumers' favour in just under half (48%) of cases completed in the first half of the year.\\nThe figures show that payday lending was one area in which complaints had risen in the first half of the year, up from 1,213 in the previous six months. Some 53% of payday complaints were upheld.\\nThe ombudsman said the rise was partly due to greater consumer awareness of their rights.\\nThe Consumer Finance Association, which represents some of the major payday providers, claimed most customers felt they were treated better by payday operators than by other types of lenders.\\nRussell Hamblin-Boone, the association's chief executive, said: \"We are obviously disappointed with the number of complaints, but this must be viewed in perspective. Of around a million loans funded there were about 2,000 upheld complaints.\\n\"The true picture is represented by a recent customer satisfaction survey by Smart Money People, which showed that 95% of short-term credit customers felt they were treated fairly against an average of 88% of all credit customers.\"\\nPPI complaints - made by those who felt they had been mis-sold the loan insurance - fell slightly compared to the second half of 2015, continuing a trend.\\nChief financial ombudsman Caroline Wayman said that PPI still weighed heavily on the organisation's workload.\\n\"Although it is a few years now since PPI complaints peaked, we have been receiving over 3,000 a week for six years running - despite wider expectations that numbers will fall,\" she said. \"We are continuing to deal with the issues and uncertainties around PPI which remain a significant challenge for everyone involved.\"\\nPPI was designed to cover loan repayments if the policyholder fell ill or lost their job.\\nAbout 45 million policies were sold over the course of 20 years from 1990.\\nHowever, it became clear that it was mis-sold on an industrial scale to people who didn't want or need it - or would not be eligible to claim.\\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to set a June 2019 deadline for people to make claims over mis-sold PPI. Banks have so far paid out Ã‚Â£24bn in compensation.\\nThe UK's five biggest banks have set aside Ã‚Â£32.6bn to deal with the total compensation bill.\\nThis is the major reason why the largest number of complaints made to the ombudsman in the first six months of the year was about Lloyds Banking Group.\\nThe Bank of Scotland and Barclays were next on the list.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A season of struggle ultimately ending in relief, and another year of Premier League football to look forward to.\\nWhen Sam Allardyce was hired as manager in October, made some shrewd January signings and saw 15-goal striker Jermain Defoe find his shooting boots, there was almost an air of inevitability about the Black Cats staying up.\\nSo, despite consigning rivals Newcastle to the Championship, Sunderland's 2016 survival story is unlikely to go down in footballing legend.\\nThat got us thinking - what is the greatest achievement when it comes to staying up?\\nThere are plenty of contenders. This season alone, Neil Warnock's Rotherham United revival stands out as an impressive feat - an 11-match unbeaten run guiding the club from the Championship relegation zone to nine points clear of danger. There are comparable tales almost every season, too.\\nAnd incomparable tales - a police dog called Bryn helped Torquay United to stay up 1987; Aberdeen avoided relegation from the Scottish Premier League in 2000 because Falkirk's ground was not considered good enough to see them promoted; and Jimmy Glass - the goalkeeper's last-minute winner keeping Carlisle in League Two in 1999.\\nBut pouring over 127 years of records was quite a daunting task, so we kept to the recent past and looked at the top flight, where the prize for staying up is the most lucrative.\\nWe considered the run-in for each club by taking the last 10 games of the season into account, looking at their results - and worked out a score based on who they played too.\\nOf course, it's not an exact science, but here are our top contenders:\\nRun in: P10 W3 D1 L6 Pts 10\\nPosition with 10 games left: 18th, two points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - they stayed up by three points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 11th, including eventual champions Manchester United\\nThe Bantams' end to the season doesn't look anything special at first - their last 10 games saw five successive defeats to Coventry, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Southampton and Everton, leaving them six points from safety with five to go.\\nTheir 10 points came in their last five games - including a final day win against Liverpool at Valley Parade. Cue celebrations.\\nRun in: P10 W3 D2 L3 Pts 11\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th, five points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - they stayed up by one point\\nAverage position of teams faced: 8th, including all the top four\\nThe first team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas. Bryan Robson's team were supposedly doomed but managed to stay up despite a final-day win over Portsmouth being their only victory in their last seven games.\\nThey managed a win and a draw against two of the eventual top four (Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton) they played in the run-in as well. Portsmouth fans at the Hawthorns also celebrated at the end of the game as the Baggies' win meant their south-coast rivals Southampton dropped out of the division.\\nRun in: P10 W5 D2 L3 Pts 17\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th - six points from safety\\nFinal position: 17th - stayed up by +3 goal difference over Reading\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th - they lost to Liverpool, the only top-four side faced in the run-in.\\nFulham's tale is similar to Bradford's survival story - in that they were still six points from safety with five games to go. Roy Hodgson, who had replaced Lawrie Sanchez in December, inspired his side to three wins in their final three games - including a dramatic 3-2 victory at Manchester City. A final day win at Portsmouth secured their status, but only on goal difference.\\nRun in: P10 W5 D3 L2 Pts 18\\nPosition with 10 games left: 22nd (bottom, and three points from safety)\\nFinal position: 19th - stayed up on goal difference (+2 better than Crystal Palace, who lost 3-0 at Arsenal)\\nAverage position of teams faced: 10th\\nPaul Scholes' favourite club stayed up by the skin of their teeth in the Premier League's inaugural season, largely thanks to three wins in their last three matches. That included a victory at title-chasing Aston Villa, as well as beating sixth-placed Liverpool in the penultimate game of the campaign.\\nOnly champions Manchester United and a fourth-placed Blackburn Rovers side with Alan Shearer up front scored more goals than Oldham that season.\\nRun in: P10 W4 D3 L3 Pts 18\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th (three points from safety)\\nFinal position: 16th - stayed up by two points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th\\nFacing six sides in the bottom half of the table certainly helped the Graeme Souness-led Saints to survive in those final 10 games. The signing of Ali Dia did not.\\nAfter losing to top-six sides Arsenal and Chelsea, Southampton went on a seven-match unbeaten run that ensured they only needed a draw in their last game to stay up. They lost, but stayed up all the same as other results went their way.\\nRun in: P10 W6 D2 L2 Pts 20\\nPosition with 10 games left: 19th (eight points from safety)\\nFinal position: 17th - stayed up by four points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 11th\\nWhen Alain Perrin was sacked mid-season, Portsmouth enticed ex-boss Harry Redknapp back to the club from neighbours Southampton. It looked like a poisoned chalice, with the struggling side firmly in the relegation zone.\\nBut end-of-season Champions League form saw Pompey turn an eight-point gap into a healthy four-point cushion over 10 games, with survival confirmed before a final-day loss at home to third-placed Liverpool.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D0 L3 Pts 21\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th (10 points from safety)\\nFinal position: 15th - stayed up with a three-point gap\\nAverage position of teams faced: 8th\\nIf you thought Portsmouth's late run was impressive, the Hammers overcame an even bigger gap with seven wins from their last 10 games. They even played five of the top six in that run.\\nBut the should they have stayed up? Carlos Tevez scored the only goal in the final-day win at title-winners Manchester United which confirmed survival, but the Argentina international nearly saw the club sent packing to the Championship in one of the Premier League's most controversial episodes.\\nThe signings of both Tevez and compatriot Javier Mascherano had breached third-party ownership rules, leading to the threat of a points deduction as punishment. As it was, the Premier League stopped short of this measure, fining the club Â£5.5m.\\nThe other relegated clubs were less than pleased, though. Sheffield United took the matter to a tribunal which resulted in the London club paying Â£20m in compensation to the Blades.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D1 L2 Pts 22\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th - one point from safety\\nFinal position: 15th- stayed up by seven points\\nAverage position of teams faced: 10th\\nWigan's remarkable run-in included wins at Arsenal and at home to title-chasing Manchester United, a 4-0 hammering of a Newcastle United side that had hoped to secure Champions League football and only a last-minute winner stopped them getting a point at Chelsea.\\nHad they not faced the bottom two clubs in their last two games - by which point they were already safe - the average position of the teams faced in their run in would have been seventh. It was all in stark contrast to a side that had conceded three or more goals 10 times up to that point.\\nRun in: P10 W7 D1 L2 Pts 22\\nPosition with 10 games left: 20th - seven points off safety\\nFinal position: 14th - six points from the relegation zone\\nAverage position of teams faced: 12th\\nAfter spending four and a half months propping up the Premier League table, struggling Leicester were dead and buried as far as most pundits were concerned. True, they had played well for much of the season but lacked the real quality to turn performances into points, it was said.\\nSeven wins from their last nine turned that theory on its head, as the supposedly doomed club landed practically in mid-table.\\nThey were, though, helped by the fact most games were against other clubs in the bottom half of the table.\\nMaybe that's why they remained most people's tip for relegation the following year...\\nLet us know your thoughts - and which stories from the wider football world deserve to be in there?

The shape-shift alters the chemistry of the cell and results in electrical signals being sent to the brain.\\nTests showed that injecting Denaq into the eyes of blind mice restored a degree of vision. There were changes in behaviour, although it is not clear how well the mice could see.\\nThe effects wore off quickly, but mice could still detect light a week later.\\nOne of the researchers, Dr Richard Kramer, said: \"Further testing on larger mammals is needed to assess the short and long-term safety of Denaq.\\n\"It will take several more years, but if safety can be established, these compounds might ultimately be useful for restoring light sensitivity to blind humans.\\n\"How close they can come to re-establishing normal vision remains to be seen.\"\\nIt is hoped the drug could eventually help with diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.\\nThe researchers envisage using electronic goggles to beam appropriate intensity light on to the retina to improve the efficiency.\\nProf Astrid Limb, from the Institute for Ophthalmology at University College London, told the BBC: \"It's a very interesting concept that you can stimulate the remaining cells.\\n\"However, there is still a lot of work to do before this research can be applied to humans.\"\\nShe added the drug's duration would need to be addressed, asking: \"Can you imagine giving an injection every few days?\"\\nThe findings add to a range of developments in restoring sight to the blind which also include transplanting stem cells into the back of the eye to restore vision and manipulating DNA to correct genetic defects.</td>\n",
